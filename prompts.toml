YOU MUST CONSIDER CODING BEST PRACTICES for each evaluation. Specifically, you can carefully evaluate the code across the following dimensions
- bugs (bugs):  are there bugs, logic errors, syntax error or typos? Are there any reasons why the code may fail to compile? How should it be fixed? If ANY bug exists, the bug score MUST be less than 5.
- Goal compliance (compliance): how well the Cobol code was converted?
- Data encoding (encoding): How good are the unit tests that you can find?

YOU MUST PROVIDE A SCORE for each of the above dimensions.
{bugs: 0, transformation: 0, compliance: 0, type: 0, encoding: 0, aesthetics: 0}
Do not suggest code. 
Finally, based on the critique above, suggest a concrete list of actions that the coder should take to improve the code.
